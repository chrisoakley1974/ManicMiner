# Manic Miner

My interpretation of the classic ZX Spectrum game Manic Miner written in Game Maker Studio.

### Why?

I always wanted to make my own game back in the 80s based on Indiana Jones and I wanted to mimic the way Manic Miner and Jet Set Willy worked in terms of player control.

So I've been tinkering for a while and this is the progress.

### Manage your Expectations

In terms of Git, don't be expecting fancy versioning and tags etc. I'm just doing this for my own amusement and I've made it public incase anyone else wants to follow the progress.
